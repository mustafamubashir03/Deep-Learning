I’m passionate about building things from scratch and love exploring new ways to innovate and grow. 🚀\\nCurrently, I work on both mobile and web app development, taking projects from the initial design phase all the way to database design, backend development, and seamless deployment. I’m diving deep into AI/ML, integrating these technologies into my apps, and am even working towards building and deploying AI solutions from the ground up. 🤖\\nI follow a holistic approach to learning—mastering one area while gaining a solid understanding of other subfields in Computer Science (think T-shaped, U-shaped—honestly, I don’t remember the exact shape, but you get the idea!). 💡 My main focus is on sharpening my problem-solving, quick learning, and analytical skills, as I believe these are the foundation of everything else. \\nEven though I’m working across various complex domains, I still consider myself a junior student 👨\\u200d💻—it helps keep me humble and constantly motivated to explore, learn, and improve. When I need a break from all the tech, I unwind by practicing digital art, drawing inspiration mostly from anime and 3D fictional characters—it fuels my creativity and brings me joy.'"
